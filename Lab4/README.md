#Lab 4 - Simple Chat Server

This is a simple chat server built from the thread-pooled server built in Lab 2

#N/B - Testing Issue
	
At the time of writing, its not working with the test server at all - can't seem to connect. Lab2 worked before..

However, my tests with the clients shows that it does respond the to the basic commands as laid out 
in the spec.
